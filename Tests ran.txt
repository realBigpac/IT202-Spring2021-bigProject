During the course of creating this app I ran into a variety of problems and also had some suggestions made to improve my app by my friends

Crypto users like to stay completely anonymous -- the fix to this is to give an online/offline option so that the location where the user searched from is not displayed on the map

It is hard to tell whether you're still in the form tab or if you're in the search tab -- fixed the tabs so that the current tab is properly displayed

Why is there a card that says what is on the results in search -- fixed the example card showing at all times in the search tab

The website is very bland -- work on the display of the website will continually be done as it is used
